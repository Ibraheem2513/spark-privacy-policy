    <h1>Privacy Policy for Contributor Spark AI SEO</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 2025</p>

    <p>Contributor Spark AI SEO ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Chrome Extension handles your data.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>We do not collect personal information such as your name, email address, or phone number. We do not require you to create an account with us to use the basic features.</p>

    <h2>2. Device Identification</h2>
    <p>To manage trial limits (12 images/day) and verify licenses, we generate a random unique Device ID. This ID is stored in your Google Sync Storage to maintain your premium status across re-installations. This ID is anonymous and cannot be used to identify you personally.</p>

    <h2>3. API Keys</h2>
    <p>Your Google Gemini API Keys are stored locally on your device (in Chrome's Local Storage). They are never sent to our servers or stored in our database. They are only transmitted directly to Google's servers to generate metadata.</p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We use Google Gemini AI to generate titles and keywords. By using this extension, you are subject to Google's Privacy Policy regarding the data processed by their AI models.</p>

    <h2>5. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions, please contact us at: [Apna Email Likhein]</p>
